Prop 301 by Smitster
--------------------
A rule change contains generalized changes in points when it contains all of the following:
 1. point changes within do not solely apply as a result of that rule change itself
 2. point changes within do not specify any player by name
A rule change that contains language relating to the changing of points that does not meet the above criteria will be referred to as a rule change containing a direct change in points, and is impermissible.  This effect takes precedence over all other rules relating to direct changes in points.
Other than providing the definition for them, this rule does not govern rule changes that contain generalized changes in points.
