Initial Protected Rules
=======================

101
---
All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of rules 101-116 (protected) and 201-213 (mutable).

102
---
Initially, rules in the 100's are protected and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (ie, changed from protected to mutable or vice versa) may be protected or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

103
---
A rule change includes one of the following:
 1. the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule
 2. the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a protected rule
 3. the transmutation of a protected rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa

104
---
All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

105
---
Every player is an eligible voter. Votes on a proposal are counted after both of these conditions are met: 
 1. a quorum of at least 60% of eligible voters have registered their vote
 2. 5 days have passed since the proposal was published or all eligible voters have voted.
If a quorum could not be mustered within 7 days of the proposal being published, then the proposal expires and is not considered adopted nor defeated. Eligible voters may register a vote of “present” for the purpose of establishing a quorum without voting to adopt or defeat the proposal.

106
---
Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is voted on. If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

107
---
No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive application.

108
---
Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number (ordinal number) for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.
If a rule is repealed and then re-enacted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to re-enact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. 

109
---
Rule changes that enact, repeal, amend, transmute protected rules into mutable rules, or vice versa, may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters.

110
---
Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some protected rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are wholly void and without effect. They do not implicitly transmute protected rules into mutable rules and at the same time amend them. Rule changes that transmute protected rules into mutable rules will be effective if and only if they explicitly state their transmuting effect.

111
---
If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or clearly destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule changes compounded, or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides on the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and vote. The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative vote.

112
---
The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed from achieving N points to any other state of affairs. However, the magnitude of N and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

113
---
A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

114
---
There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.

115
---
Rules changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

116
---
Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

Initial Mutable Rules
=====================

201
---
Players shall alternate in the below order taking one whole turn apiece.  taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points. If new players enter the game, their names would be inserted into the list at the position prior to the current player.  If a player leaves or is removed from the game, their entry from the list is removed as well:
 * smitster
 * z
 * AstroTimeLord
 * Sebastian Deka
 * carmex
 * boltar

202
---
One turn consists of two parts, in this order:
 1. proposing one rule change and then having it voted on. The rule shall be proposed on slack, in the #nomic channel. 
 2. throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score. The die shall be rolled on slack using the command `/roll 1d6`.

203
---
A rule change is adopted if and only if the results of the vote in favor of the rule change is greater than 50% among the eligible voters, unless there is some specific condition which requires an even greater percentage provided by another rule.

204
---
If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points apiece.

205
---
An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

206
---
When a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

207
---
Each player has exactly one vote.

208
---
The winner is the first person to achieve 100 (positive) points.

209
---
At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.

210
---
Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule changes unless they are teammates.

211
---
If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more protected rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type or rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.
If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method must again govern.

212
---
Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any player. Such a process is called *invoking judgement*.
If judgement is invoked by a player, then a player will be chosen at random to be the Judge from a Candidate Set of players that excludes the current player, the player invoking judgement, and the previous turn’s player.  The `/roll 1dX` command shall be used in combination with a predetermined sequence of that Candidate Set.
When judgement has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her own turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.
The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players, taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's judgement is overruled, the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, except that no player is to be Judge during his own turn or during the turn of a teammate.
Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.
New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which judgement was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge's only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and the spirit of the game.

213
---
If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player who is unable to complete a turn is the winner.
This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.

Rules Enacted During Play
=========================

301
A rule change contains generalized changes in points when it contains all of the following:
 1. point changes within do not solely apply as a result of that rule change itself
 2. point changes within do not specify any player by name
A rule change that contains language relating to the changing of points that does not meet the above criteria will be referred to as a rule change containing a direct change in points, and is impermissible.  This effect takes precedence over all other rules relating to direct changes in points.
Other than providing the definition for them, this rule does not govern rule changes that contain generalized changes in points.
